### 561. Array Partition I
**LeetCode link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/array-partition-i/description/

**Problem description:**
Given an array of 2n integers, your task is to group these integers into n pairs of integer, say (a1, b1), (a2, b2), ..., (an, bn) which makes sum of min(ai, bi) for all i from 1 to n as large as possible.

### 566. Reshape the Matrix
**LeetCode link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/reshape-the-matrix/description/

**Problem description:**
In MATLAB, there is a very useful function called 'reshape', which can reshape a matrix into a new one with different size but keep its original data.

You're given a matrix represented by a two-dimensional array, and two positive integers r and c representing the row number and column number of the wanted reshaped matrix, respectively.

The reshaped matrix need to be filled with all the elements of the original matrix in the same row-traversing order as they were.

If the 'reshape' operation with given parameters is possible and legal, output the new reshaped matrix; Otherwise, output the original matrix.

### 442. Find All Duplicates in an Array
**LeetCode link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/find-all-duplicates-in-an-array/description/

**Problem description:**
Given an array of integers, 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ n (n = size of array), some elements appear twice and others appear once.

Find all the elements that appear twice in this array.

Could you do it without extra space and in O(n) runtime?
